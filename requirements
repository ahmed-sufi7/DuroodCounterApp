# Durood Counter App Requirements

## Overview

React Native mobile app using Expo for counting Durood recitations with a collective goal of 15 crore (150 million) before Milad un Nabi 2025.

## Core Features

### 1. Main Counter Screen

- Large tally counter button for incrementing durood count
- Display current user's personal count
- Display global/total count from all users
- Target display: 15,00,00,000 (15 crore)
- Progress bar showing percentage completed toward target
- Countdown timer to Milad un Nabi 2025

### 2. Manual Upload Feature

- Input field to manually add bulk durood count
- "Add Count" button to submit the manual entry
- Confirmation dialog before adding large numbers

### 3. Real-time Updates

- Global counter updates in real-time when any user increments
- Use Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for live sync
- Local counter persists even when offline

### 4. Data Storage

- No authentication required (anonymous users)
- Store user's personal count locally (AsyncStorage)
- Store global count in Firebase
- Each increment/upload updates both local and global counters

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Database**: Firebase (Realtime Database or Firestore)
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage for personal counts
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect (keep it simple)

## UI Requirements

- Simple, clean Islamic-themed design
- Large, easily tappable counter button
- Clear display of numbers with proper formatting (commas/localization)
- Green/gold color scheme
- Arabic/Islamic typography if possible

## Key Screens

1. **Main Screen**: Counter + Global stats + Manual upload
2. **That's it** - keep it single screen focused

## Data Structure

```
Firebase:
- globalCount: number
- lastUpdated: timestamp

Local Storage:
- personalCount: number
- lastSynced: timestamp
```

## MVP Features Only

- Tally counter button
- Manual count upload
- Real-time global counter
- Local persistence
- Amazing UI

## What NOT to include (keep simple)

- User profiles/auth
- Leaderboards
- Push notifications
- Complex animations
- Social features
